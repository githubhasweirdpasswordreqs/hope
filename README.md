## Reach

`Reach` is a website focused on mental health, which provides services such as allowing users to create personalised accounts, write & save journal entries, as well as plan and undertake meditation sessions.

This project was originally created for a hackathon, whereby its backend was written in node.js. It's implementation was rife with bugs, and so after the hackathon concluded I decided to **re-write the entire backend in Django** (a Python backend framework).

The entire codebase for the website is open-source and presented above. This project is still currently active and is served at the domain `https://reach-ncpcs.ondigitalocean.app`. Check it out and let me know your thoughts!
